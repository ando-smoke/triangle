Triangle Evaluator
======================

Takes in three positive integers and determines whether or not
they could make up valid side lengths of a triangle. If not valid,
the user is informed of the result. Otherwise, the type of triangle
is displayed (i.e. equilateral, isosceles or scalene).

Installation
------------

Clone this project onto your local system and open the enclosed
triangle.html file in your preferred web browser. Of note, a browser
utilizing HTML5 is required for proper data validation of inputs
(i.e. nonnegative integers are required for all three
fields).

Usage
-----

Enter in positive integers representing three side lengths of a
potential triangle. Next, click on the Evaluate button for the
result as to whether or not the side lengths constitute a valid
triangle.
